# My attempts at solving some leet code problems!

1. **Palindrome_simple** has the solution to check if a number is palindrome or not. The solutions include C++ and python codes by checking using string conversions and by checking numbers.
2. **two_sum** has the solution to return the indices of elements in an array that sum up to a target number. The solution includes C++ and python codes that use 2 for loops and another approach that uses hash maps.

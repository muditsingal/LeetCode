1. **Palindrome_simple** has the solution to check if a number is palindrome or not. The solutions include C++ and python codes by checking using string conversions and by checking numbers.
2. **two_sum** has the solution to return the indices of elements in an array that sum up to a target number. The solution includes C++ and python codes that use 2 for loops and another approach that uses hash maps.
3. **merge_sorted_lists** has the solution to merge 2 sorted lists using linked lists and pointers to linked lists. Returns the pointer to the head of the newly created linked list of the merged input lists. The solution includes C++ and python codes that use linked lists using structure and classes respectively.
4. **ranges_sorted_array** has the solution to find continuous ranges of integers in a sorted array of integers. The solution includes both C++ and python codes that use vectors and lists respectively.
5. **eq_row_col_pairs** has the solution to find number of pairs with equal rows and columns in a 2D array. The solution includes both C++ and python codes. C++ code uses vectors and python code uses numpy array and operations.
6. **530_min_node_diff** has the solution to find the minimum difference between 2 nodes in a Binary search tree. Problem number 530 in leet code. The solution includes both C++ and python codes. C++ code uses linked lists and STL stack and python code uses a node class and stack using lists.
7. **141_linked_list_cycle** has the solution to find if a linked list has a loop in it. Problem number 141 in Leet Code. The solution uses 2 pointers. One pointer is incremented by one and the other is incremented by 2 at each iteration. The solution includes both C++ and python codes. C++ code uses pointers to linked list and python uses objects of linked list class. 
    - `Time complexity: O(n)`
    - `Space complexity: O(1)`
8. **1732_highest_altitude** has the solution to find the maximum altitude based on incremental altitude changes represented in an array. The solution uses a max variable to store the all-time highest altitude and a curr variable that stores the current cumulative altitude. The solution contains both C++ and python codes.
9. **144_preorder_BST** has the solution to perform pre-order traversal of a Binary Search TREE(BST). The solution uses recursion. The solution contains both C++ and python codes.
10. **145_postorder_BST** has the solution to perform post-order traversal of a Binary Search TREE(BST). The solution uses recursion and contains both C++ and python codes.
11. **2090_k_radius_arr_avg** has the solution to find the moving averages of subarray (with radius r) from a main array. The solution uses a single _for_ loop.Solution contains both C++ and python codes.

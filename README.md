# My attempts at solving some leet code problems!

> Author: Mudit Singal


1. **Palindrome_simple** has the solution to check if a number is palindrome or not. The solutions include C++ and python codes by checking using string conversions and by checking numbers.
2. **two_sum** has the solution to return the indices of elements in an array that sum up to a target number. The solution includes C++ and python codes that use 2 for loops and another approach that uses hash maps.
3. **merge_sorted_lists** has the solution to merge 2 sorted lists using linked lists and pointers to linked lists. Returns the pointer to the head of the newly created linked list of the merged input lists. The solution includes C++ and python codes that use linked lists using structure and classes respectively.
4. **ranges_sorted_array** has the solution to find continuous ranges of integers in a sorted array of integers. The solution includes both C++ and python codes that use vectors and lists respectively.
5. **eq_row_col_pairs** has the solution to find number of pairs with equal rows and columns in a 2D array. The solution includes both C++ and python codes. C++ code uses vectors and python code uses numpy array and operations.
